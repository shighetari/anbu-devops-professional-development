# Best Practices for a Productive and Happy Development Team

⛔️ **No room for negativity**

We choose to use the word "potato" instead of "stupid" to describe ourselves or our work. This is because it puts a smile on everyone's face and creates a more forgiving language for mistakes.

⛔️ **Open discussion on burnout**

We understand the mental and physical strain that comes with working in software development. That's why we openly discuss the importance of self-care, nutrition, and exercise. We have even dedicated a standup meeting to discussing the benefits of therapy, co-pays, and finding in-network professional help.

⛔️ **No one gets left behind**

We hold daily standup meetings where team members can bring up blockers and pair program with others. It's a safe space to ask questions and seek help. This keeps our project moving forward and provides opportunities for training sessions.

⛔️ **Think long-term**

We think not just for the client but for the team as well. We respect our current and future colleagues by creating clear documentation, efficient data structures, and future-proof solutions.

⛔️ **No apologies for learning**

We approach problems with a growth mindset and embrace learning opportunities. It's okay to not know, but it's not okay to not learn. There's no such thing as a developer who knows everything about everything.

## Bonus:

✅ Implement these ideas anywhere

These practices aren't limited to professional dev teams. You can start incorporating them during bootcamp or any other project.

✅ Foster psychological safety

Creating a safe and supportive environment has been shown to increase productivity, team happiness, and success. If you foster psychological safety, your team will be unstoppable!
