# Angular / Angular Material
- Angular is a JavaScript framework for building web applications
- Angular Material is a UI library for Angular that provides reusable, well-designed UI components based on Google's Material Design specification

## Mat Forms
- Angular Material provides a set of form controls and services to create high-quality, responsive forms
- `FormControl` is a basic form control in Angular Material, used to manage an individual form control
- `FormGroup` is a collection of form controls, used to manage multiple form controls as a single entity

## 2-way bindings
- Angular supports 2-way data binding between the view and the model, meaning changes in the view are reflected in the model and vice versa
- To bind the model and the view, use the `[(ngModel)]` directive

## Passing around data
- In Angular, data can be passed between components using `Input` and `Output` decorators
- `Input` allows a component to receive data from its parent component
- `Output` allows a component to emit data to its parent component

## Form Control
- Angular provides `FormControl` to manage individual form controls, and `FormGroup` to manage multiple form controls as a single entity
- FormControl objects have properties and methods to manage form input and validation, such as `value`, `status`, and `valid`
- A `FormGroup` contains multiple `FormControl` objects, and can be used to manage form data and validation as a whole.


💥🔥 Angular: 
Angular is a 💪🏼 powerful framework for building client-side applications using TypeScript. Angular uses a 🧱 component-based architecture and declarative templates to build applications. Angular provides a set of 💥 powerful features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a rich set of directives to create complex UI components.

🎨 Angular Material: 
Angular Material is a 📚 library of UI components designed to work with Angular. It provides a consistent look and feel for the application, with a focus on Material Design principles. Angular Material components can be easily added to an application by importing the necessary modules, and the components can be easily styled using CSS.

💼 Mat Forms: 
Mat Forms is a 📚 library of form components for Angular Material. It provides a set of form controls that can be used to build complex forms. Mat Forms includes features such as 🔒 validation, error messages, and form group management.

🔁 2-Way Bindings: 
Two-way bindings allow for data to flow both from the model to the view and from the view to the model. This allows for real-time updates of the view when the model changes, and vice versa. Angular provides two-way binding through the ngModel directive.

💼 Passing Around Data: 
Data can be passed around between components in Angular through a variety of methods, including input and output bindings, shared services, and Angular’s change detection mechanism. It is important to choose the correct method based on the specific needs of the application, as some methods can be more performant than others.

📝 Form Control: 
Form controls in Angular provide a way to manage the state and validation of form inputs. Angular provides a set of form control classes that can be used to build complex forms, including FormControl, FormGroup, and FormArray. Form control classes can be used to manage the state and validation of individual form inputs, as well as the state and validation of the form as a whole.

⚠️ Note: This information is based on Angular and Angular Material version 10 and higher.
